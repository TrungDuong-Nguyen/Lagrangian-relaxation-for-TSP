# Lagrangian Relaxation for the travelling salesman problem

This mini-project is realized within the course _0S01 - Fondements de la Recherche Opérationnelle_ (_Fundamentals of Operations Research_) for student of the Master program _Optimisation et Securité des Systèmes_ (_Optimization and Systems Safety_)__, semester Autumn 2012 at University of Technology of Troyes (France).

Hereafter, I present firstly ... Next, ..

The original French document [Relaxation-lagrangienne-pour-le-probleme-du-voyageur-de-commerce](/Relaxation-lagrangienne-pour-le-probleme-du-voyageur-de-commerce.pdf) presents the theory foundations, algorithms, as well as task assignments of the project. I selectively translate some important parts of this document into English at [Theory-foundation_brief](/Theory-Foundation_brief.pdf).

The algorithms in this project are implemented using Matlab.
