# Lagrangian Relaxation for the travelling salesman problem

This mini-project is realized within the course _0S01 - Fondements de la 
Recherche Op√©rationnelle_ which is taught for student of the Master program __, semester Autumn 2012 at University of Technology of Troyes (France).

Hereafter, I present firstly ... Next, ..

The programming language used in this project are Matlab.

## 1. General principle of Lagrangian Relaxation

Consider a mathematical program _(P)_ with a vector _x_ of _n_ variables and _m_ constraints. _f_ is the objective function and ![\g_i(x)](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?%5Cinline%20g_i(x)) are the constraint functions.

 _S_ is a subset of R defined by other constraints. For example, for an integer linear programming, f and gi are linear and S = N.
