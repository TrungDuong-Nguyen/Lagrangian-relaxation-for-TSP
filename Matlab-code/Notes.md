- Function `Random_TSP.m` generates a random TSP which contains (n) nodes distributed randomly in a rectangle of size (Xmax x Ymax)

- Function `Read_TSP.m` reads the data (the number of nodes, and their coordinates) from a text-file.

- Function `Compute_C.m` uses the data provided by function `Read_TSP.m` to compute the matrix of distances between nodes.

- Two functions `Farthest_Insertion.m` and `One_Tree.m` both take the number of nodes and the matrix distances between nodes as input parameters, then apply respectively heuristic method Farthest Insertion and algorithm "1_Tree" to compute the aggregate distance of the journey.

- The functions `Sub_Gradient_R1.m`, `Sub_Gradient_R2.m`, `Sub_Gradient_R3.m` are three variants (make a footnote here, that cites to paragraph "example of classis rules" in the end of section 2, document Theory-Foundation_brief.pdf)
that apply method subgradient to compute the aggregate distance of the journey. More specifically, the only difference between these three functions is at the way they update the value of step "lambda" used in method subgradient.

Notice that the functions Sub_Gradient internally call to function `One_Tree.m` as method subgradient is implemented on the basis of algorithm "1_Tree".

- Two functions `plot_Cycle.m` and `plot_Aretes.m` are used to draw the path found using methods Farthest Insertion and subgradient, respectively.

- Program `Main1.m` performs the works in [**Task 5** - _Evaluation of the methods on given test data_](refer to section on README.md] typically for the case of Rule 1 (lambda = 1).

- Program `Main2.m` performs the works in [**Task 6** - _Statistical evaluation](refer to section on README.md] typically for the case of Rule 1 (lambda = 1).

For the work in task 6, we must eliminate the codeline:
```
C(i,j)= round(C(i,j)); 
```
which is used to round up the distance, in the functionÂ `Compute_C.m`.
